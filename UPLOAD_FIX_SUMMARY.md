## Features Added

### Upload Progress Tracking

const [uploadedFiles, setUploadedFiles] = useState<{[key: string]: boolean}>({})
```

### Automatic Bucket Creation
```typescript
// Check if bucket exists, create if needed
const { data: buckets } = await supabase.storage.listBuckets()
const bucketExists = buckets?.some(bucket => bucket.name === 'app_docs')

if (!bucketExists) {
  await supabase.storage.createBucket('app_docs', {
    public: true,
    allowedMimeTypes: [...]
  })
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see selected files instantly
2. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time upload progress with percentages
3. **Success Confirmation**: Clear visual confirmation when uploads complete
4. **Error Handling**: Descriptive error messages for troubleshooting
5. **Smooth Animations**: Professional-looking transitions and feedback

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test file uploads with different file types (PDF, JPG, PNG)
2. Test with large files to see progress tracking
3. Test error scenarios (invalid file types, network issues)
4. Verify bucket creation works on first upload
5. Check animations work smoothly across different browsers

## Bucket Configuration

The `app_docs` bucket is configured with:
- **Public access**: Yes (for easy file retrieval)
- **Allowed file types**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, JPEG, PNG
- **File size limit**: 10MB per file
- **Auto-creation**: Yes (created automatically on first upload)

## Next Steps

1. Test the upload functionality thoroughly
2. Monitor Supabase storage usage
3. Consider adding file compression for large images
4. Add file preview functionality if needed
5. Implement file deletion from storage when applications are deleted
