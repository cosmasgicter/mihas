## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account and project
- Environment variables configured

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mihas

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials

# Set up database and storage
npm run storage:setup

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app

# Application URL (for email links, defaults to API base URL if not set)
VITE_APP_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com

# Optional: Cloudflare Turnstile (for bot protection)
VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_turnstile_site_key

# Optional: Analytics
VITE_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=true
```

> ℹ️ The service role key is required for API routes because they run with elevated privileges on the server. Store it only in secure server-side environments (e.g., Vercel environment variables or a local `.env` file) and never expose it to the browser bundle.

> 🔧 **API Configuration**: Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to override the API base URL. If not set, the application will use `window.location.origin` as fallback. This is useful for different deployment environments or local development with custom ports.

> 🔗 **Application URLs**: Set `VITE_APP_BASE_URL` to configure the base URL used in email links and notifications. If not set, it defaults to the API base URL. This allows you to use a different domain for user-facing links than your API endpoints.

### Local API Development

Use Vercel's development runtime to run the microservices with the same configuration as production:

```bash
# Link the project once
npx vercel login
npx vercel link

# Start the API/microservices emulator
npm run dev:api
```

`vercel dev` automatically loads environment variables from `.env.local`, `.env`, and the linked Vercel project so your Supabase credentials remain consistent between development and production.
