**Date**: $(date)  
**Auditor**: Amazon Q Developer  
**Scope**: Full application security review  
**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

## Executive Summary

The MIHAS Application System has undergone a comprehensive security audit and all critical vulnerabilities have been addressed. The application is now production-ready with enhanced security measures implemented throughout the codebase and database.

## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability (CRITICAL) ✅ FIXED
- **Location**: `src/hooks/useApplicationsData.ts`
- **Issue**: Unsanitized user input in database queries
- **Fix**: Implemented proper input sanitization with escape characters
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious SQL execution

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (HIGH) ✅ FIXED
- **Locations**: 
  - `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
  - `src/pages/student/ApplicationForm.tsx`
- **Issue**: User input not properly sanitized before display
- **Fix**: Enhanced `sanitizeForDisplay` function usage throughout application
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious script injection

### 3. Log Injection (HIGH) ✅ FIXED
- **Locations**: Multiple files with console.error statements
- **Issue**: User input logged without sanitization
- **Fix**: Implemented `sanitizeForLog` function for all user input logging
- **Impact**: Prevents log manipulation and injection attacks
