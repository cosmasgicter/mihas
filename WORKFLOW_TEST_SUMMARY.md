## 🔗 Deployment Verification Needed

Current test results show 404 errors, indicating:
- Site may not be deployed to `mihas-katc.netlify.app`
- URL might be different
- Deployment may be in progress

**Next Steps:**
1. Confirm correct deployment URL
2. Verify site is accessible
3. Run tests against live system
4. Document any issues found

## 📞 Test Execution Support

### Before Testing
- Verify deployment is live
- Confirm credentials are active
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure stable internet connection

### During Testing
- Document any errors encountered
- Take screenshots of issues
- Note response times
- Check mobile compatibility

### After Testing
- Compile results summary
- Report critical issues immediately
- Suggest improvements
- Plan follow-up testing

## 🎉 Ready to Test

The complete testing suite is ready. Once the deployment URL is confirmed and the site is accessible, you can:

1. **Run automated tests** for quick validation
2. **Use manual testing** for thorough verification
3. **Check system health** for basic connectivity
4. **Follow documentation** for detailed guidance

All test files are configured with your real credentials and will test the complete workflow from student application to admin approval using actual system functionality.
