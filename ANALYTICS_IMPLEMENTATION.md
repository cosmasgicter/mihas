## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

#### Accessing Analytics
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Click "Analytics & Reports" button
3. View real-time metrics and trends

#### Generating Reports
1. Go to Analytics page
2. Use the Reports Generator component
3. Select report type and date range
4. Choose data sections to include
5. Click "Generate & Download Report"

#### Viewing Trends

### For Developers

#### Adding Analytics Tracking
```typescript
// Import the hook
import { useAnalytics } from '@/hooks/useAnalytics'

// Use in component
const { trackAction, trackFormStart, trackFormSubmit } = useAnalytics()

// Track custom events
trackAction('button_click', { button_name: 'submit_application' })
trackFormStart('application_form')
trackFormSubmit('application_form', true)
```

#### Extending Analytics
1. Add new event types to the analytics service
2. Create new database tables for additional metrics
3. Update the dashboard to display new data
4. Add new report types as needed

## Data Privacy and Security

### Privacy Compliance
- User data is anonymized where possible
- Personal information is not included in analytics
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- User consent for analytics tracking

### Security Measures
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all analytics tables
- Admin-only access to detailed analytics
- Encrypted data transmission
- Regular security audits

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields
- Batch processing for large data sets
- Caching of frequently accessed metrics
- Asynchronous report generation

### Scalability
- Partitioned tables for large datasets
- Automated data archiving
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Load balancing for high traffic

## Future Enhancements
