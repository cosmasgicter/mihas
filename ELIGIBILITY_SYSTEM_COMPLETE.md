course_requirements
eligibility_rules
regulatory_guidelines
prerequisites

-- Assessment and tracking
eligibility_assessments
alternative_pathways

```

## 📁 File Structure

### Core Engine
- `src/lib/eligibilityEngine.ts` - Main eligibility assessment engine
- `src/lib/eligibility.ts` - Enhanced with comprehensive features
- `src/hooks/useEligibilityChecker.ts` - React hooks for real-time checking

### Components

- `src/components/application/EligibilityReport.tsx` - Detailed assessment reports

### Admin Interface
- `src/pages/admin/EligibilityManagement.tsx` - Admin management interface

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. **EligibilityEngine Class**
```typescript
class EligibilityEngine {
  async assessEligibility(applicationId, programId, grades)
  async getAssessmentHistory(applicationId)
  async submitAppeal(applicationId, assessmentId, reason, documents)
  // ... other methods
}
```

### 2. **Real-time Assessment Flow**
1. Student selects subjects and enters grades
2. System automatically triggers eligibility check
3. Assessment calculated using weighted scoring
4. Results displayed with detailed breakdown
5. Missing requirements identified with suggestions
6. Alternative pathways recommended if applicable

### 3. **Scoring Algorithm**
```typescript
// Weighted scoring calculation
totalScore = (subjectCountScore * 0.3) + 
             (gradeAverageScore * 0.3) + 
             (coreSubjectsScore * 0.4)

// Status determination
if (criticalMissing > 0) status = 'not_eligible'
else if (score >= 80) status = eligible ? 'eligible' : 'conditional'
else if (score >= 60) status = 'conditional'
else status = 'not_eligible'
```
