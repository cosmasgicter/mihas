# Security Fixes Applied to MIHAS/KATC Application

## Overview
This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the MIHAS/KATC application system.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Code Injection Vulnerabilities (Critical)
**Files Affected:** `src/lib/workflowAutomation.ts`, `src/hooks/useErrorHandling.ts`

**Issue:** Dynamic function execution using operator mapping could allow code injection
**Fix:** Replaced dynamic function execution with explicit switch statements
**Impact:** Prevents arbitrary code execution attacks

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (High)
**Files Affected:** Multiple files including `src/lib/sanitize.ts`, `src/lib/emailService.ts`

**Issue:** User input not properly sanitized before HTML output
**Fixes Applied:**
- Strengthened HTML sanitization with stricter whitelists
- Added length limits to prevent oversized content attacks
- Enhanced object sanitization with key validation
- Removed dangerous HTML attributes and tags

### 3. Log Injection Vulnerabilities (High)
**Files Affected:** `src/pages/student/ApplicationWizard.tsx`, `src/hooks/useErrorHandling.ts`

**Issue:** Unsanitized user input in log entries
**Fix:** Implemented proper log sanitization using `sanitizeForLog()` function
**Impact:** Prevents log manipulation and forging

### 4. Cross-Origin Communication Vulnerabilities (High)
**Files Affected:** `src/lib/secureMessaging.ts`

**Issue:** Missing origin verification in postMessage operations
**Fix:** Enforced strict origin verification and prevented wildcard usage
**Impact:** Prevents unauthorized cross-origin attacks

### 5. Path Traversal Vulnerabilities (High)
**Files Affected:** `remove-external-deps.js`, `setup-admin-fixes.js`

**Issue:** Unsafe path construction from user input
**Fix:** Implemented secure path validation and used direct path construction
**Impact:** Prevents unauthorized file system access

## Security Enhancements Added

### 1. Centralized Security Utilities
**File:** `src/lib/securityUtils.ts`
- Unified input validation and sanitization
- Secure logging wrapper
- Application-specific data sanitization
- CSP nonce generation

### 2. Enhanced Sanitization Library
**File:** `src/lib/sanitize.ts` (Updated)
- Stricter HTML sanitization
- Improved object sanitization with prototype pollution protection
- Enhanced validation functions

### 3. Security Audit Script
**File:** `security-audit.js`
- Automated security pattern detection
- Comprehensive file scanning
- Security recommendations

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Input Sanitization
```typescript
// Always sanitize user inputs
const safeInput = sanitizeText(userInput)
const safeEmail = validateAndSanitizeInput(email, 'email')
```

### Secure Logging
```typescript
// Use secure logging to prevent log injection
secureLog('error', 'Operation failed', errorData)
console.error('Error:', sanitizeForLog(error))
```

### HTML Output Protection
```typescript
// Use strict HTML sanitization
const safeHtml = sanitizeHtml(content, ['p', 'br', 'strong'])
```

### Cross-Origin Security
```typescript
// Always verify origins
if (!verifyOrigin(event.origin, ALLOWED_ORIGINS)) {
  return // Reject unauthorized origins
}
```

## Testing and Validation

### Security Audit Commands
```bash
# Run comprehensive security audit
npm run security-scan

# Run dependency vulnerability check
npm run security-audit
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] All user inputs are sanitized
- [ ] Log entries use sanitizeForLog()
- [ ] HTML output uses DOMPurify
- [ ] File paths are validated
- [ ] Cross-origin communications verify origins
- [ ] No dynamic code execution

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
1. Run `npm run security-scan` before each deployment
2. Update dependencies regularly with `npm audit fix`
3. Review new code for security patterns
4. Monitor application logs for suspicious activity

### Security Headers
Ensure the following security headers are configured:
- Content-Security-Policy
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

## Compliance and Standards

### Security Standards Met
- OWASP Top 10 protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- Secure communication protocols
- Error handling without information disclosure

### Regulatory Compliance
- Data protection principles (GDPR-ready)
- Healthcare data security standards
- Educational institution security requirements

## Emergency Response

### If Security Issue Detected
1. Immediately isolate affected systems
2. Run security audit: `npm run security-scan`
3. Review application logs
4. Apply fixes using established patterns
5. Test thoroughly before redeployment
