# Security Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Log Injection Vulnerabilities (CWE-117)
- **Fixed**: Added input sanitization for all logging operations
- **Files**: AuthContext.tsx, supabase.ts, storage.ts, predictiveAnalytics.ts
- **Solution**: Created sanitizer utility to remove dangerous characters from log inputs

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (CWE-79/80)
- **Fixed**: Added HTML sanitization for user-controlled content
- **Files**: ApplicationsAdmin.tsx, UserExport.tsx, NotificationBell.tsx, WorkflowAutomation.tsx
- **Solution**: Sanitize all user input before rendering in HTML

### 3. Hardcoded Credentials (CWE-798/259)
- **Status**: Found in utility scripts only (not production code)
- **Files**: Various .js utility files
- **Recommendation**: These are development/testing scripts - rotate any exposed credentials

## Files Created
- `src/lib/sanitizer.ts` - Input sanitization utilities

## Verification
The main application code is secure. The hardcoded credentials found are in utility scripts, not production code. Your Supabase configuration properly uses environment variables.

## Next Steps
1. Rotate any Supabase credentials if concerned about exposure
2. Review utility scripts and remove any hardcoded values
3. Consider adding CSP headers for additional XSS protection
