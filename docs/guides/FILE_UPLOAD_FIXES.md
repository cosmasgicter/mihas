# File Upload Fixes - MIHAS/KATC Application System

## Issues Identified

1. **Complex Upload Logic**: The original `uploadFileWithProgress` function had overly complex bucket fallback logic
2. **Missing Error Handling**: Insufficient validation and error feedback for users
3. **Storage Configuration**: Potential issues with bucket creation and permissions
4. **File Validation**: Inconsistent file validation across components

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Storage Library (`src/lib/storage.ts`)

**New Features:**
- Added `uploadApplicationFile()` - Simplified upload function specifically for application files
- Added `validateApplicationFile()` - Streamlined file validation
- Improved bucket fallback logic with better error handling
- Set buckets to public for easier access

**Key Changes:**
```typescript
// New simplified upload function
export async function uploadApplicationFile(
  file: File,
  userId: string,
  applicationId: string,
  fileType: string
): Promise<UploadResult>

// Simple validation function
export function validateApplicationFile(file: File): { valid: boolean; error?: string }
```

### 2. Updated Application Wizard (`src/pages/student/ApplicationWizard.tsx`)

**Improvements:**
- Simplified `uploadFileWithProgress` function to use new storage utilities
- Added immediate file validation on file selection
- Better error messages and user feedback
- Cleaner progress tracking

**Key Changes:**
- Uses `uploadApplicationFile` from storage library
- Validates files immediately when selected
- Clearer error messages for users

### 3. Enhanced SimpleFileUpload Component (`src/components/application/SimpleFileUpload.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- Direct upload handling within the component
- Real-time file validation
- Better error state management
- Integrated with storage utilities

### 4. Test Components and Pages

**Created:**
- `FileUploadTest.tsx` - React component for testing uploads
- `test-upload-page.html` - Standalone HTML test page
- `setup-storage-buckets.js` - Script to ensure buckets exist
- `test-upload-fix.js` - Node.js test script

## How to Test the Fixes

### Option 1: Use the HTML Test Page
1. Open `test-upload-page.html` in a browser
2. Try uploading different file types and sizes
3. Check console for detailed error messages

### Option 2: Test in the Application
1. Navigate to the application wizard
2. Try uploading files in Step 2 (Education) and Step 3 (Payment)
3. Verify immediate validation feedback

### Option 3: Run Test Scripts
```bash
# Test storage setup
node setup-storage-buckets.js

# Test upload functionality
node test-upload-fix.js
```

## File Upload Flow

1. **File Selection**: User selects file via input
2. **Immediate Validation**: File size and type checked instantly
3. **Upload Process**: File uploaded to available bucket (app_docs, documents, or application-documents)
4. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar with percentage
5. **Success/Error Feedback**: Clear messages to user
6. **File Management**: Ability to remove uploaded files

## Supported File Types

- **PDF**: `application/pdf`
- **JPEG**: `image/jpeg`
- **JPG**: `image/jpg` (converted to jpeg)
- **PNG**: `image/png`

## File Size Limits

- **Maximum**: 10MB per file
- **Validation**: Checked before upload starts

## Storage Buckets

The system tries these buckets in order:
1. `app_docs` (primary)
2. `documents` (fallback)
3. `application-documents` (fallback)

## Error Handling

### Client-Side Validation
- File size validation (10MB limit)
- File type validation (PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG only)
- Immediate feedback to user

### Upload Error Handling
- Multiple bucket fallback
- Clear error messages
- Progress tracking with failure recovery

### User Feedback
- Real-time validation messages
- Upload progress indicators
- Success/failure notifications

## Security Considerations

- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- File size limits prevent abuse
- User-specific folder structure
- Sanitized file names

## Performance Optimizations

- Immediate client-side validation
- Progress tracking for user experience
- Efficient bucket fallback logic
- Proper cleanup of temporary states

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** using the provided test tools
2. **Monitor upload success rates** in production
3. **Consider adding** file preview functionality
4. **Implement** automatic file compression for large images
5. **Add** drag-and-drop support for better UX

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"No available buckets"** - Run `setup-storage-buckets.js`
2. **"File too large"** - Check 10MB limit
3. **"Invalid file type"** - Only PDF, JPG, JPEG, PNG allowed
4. **"Upload failed"** - Check network connection and Supabase status

### Debug Steps:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Check console for detailed error messages
3. Verify Supabase connection in Network tab
4. Test with the standalone HTML page first

The file upload system is now more robust, user-friendly, and easier to maintain. All uploads should work correctly with proper error handling and user feedback.
