# üö® Deployment Issue

## Problem
- ‚úÖ Local commits made (SPA routing fix)
- ‚ùå Cannot push to GitHub (authentication error)
- ‚ùå Vercel not deploying (no new commits on origin/main)

## Current Status
```
Local: 1 commit ahead of origin/main
Commit: "Fix SPA routing - add fallback to index.html"
Error: "could not read Username for 'https://github.com'"
```

## Solutions

### Option 1: GitHub Desktop/VS Code
- Use GitHub Desktop or VS Code Git extension to push
- These have stored authentication

### Option 2: SSH Key
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:cosmasgicter/mihas.git
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Personal Access Token
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://username:token@github.com/cosmasgicter/mihas.git
git push origin main
```

## Critical Fix Waiting
The SPA routing fix is committed locally but needs to be pushed to trigger Vercel deployment.

**Status:** Deployment blocked by Git authentication
